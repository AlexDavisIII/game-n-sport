#This is Game and Sport. A slight play on "Game and Watch" but only in name.
#Here we do video games and sports. What exactly? You're guess is as good as mine.
#Regardless, this page is going to be a place where I can go to talk about games, sports, and the like just for fun.
#Eventually I'll integrate some type of video thing and/or audio thing for podcasting, but until then, it's text and images
#Also down the line I plan to learn how to add keyboard shortcuts to the page. Why? Because it would be fun.
